This is a collection of study notes in various topics: risk management (credit risk, and I am now into market risk), data science and engineering, cue sports, martial arts, etc. Below are what I am interested:

-   drinking coffee;

-   listening to [Vietnamese rap/pop rock](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nnZYnQ6ou7hvXsXd3F-D_S448sd-IZu3s);

-   reading sci-fi novels, history books;

-   playing pool (mostly [ten-ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-ball));

-   training [Brazilian jiu-jitsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu);

-   and occasionally traveling or hiking.

And of course, writing these stuffs. I'm very glad to have you visiting this site. If you share the same interest, have feedback, or just want to make friend, please text me via below social platform. I am best reached via Facebook.
