::: {#about-block}
üòé I am a Data Science Enthusiast and currently working as a **Risk Modeler** at [Validus Vietnam](https://validus.vn/).

üéì Growing up in a small village next to a rice field, I opted to chase equations instead of grasshoppers by diving into math at the age of 10 (though my current math skills might say otherwise üëÄ). I later graduated with a degree in Accounting & Auditing from the [Foreign Trade University, HCMC Campus](https://www.ftu.edu.vn/).

üìö When I'm not doing data, I might be:

-   learning math/statistics/data stuff,

-   drinking coffee,

-   listening to Vietnamese rap/pop rock,

-   reading sci-fi novels, history books,

-   playing pool (mostly [ten-ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-ball)),

-   training [Brazilian jiu-jitsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu),

-   and occasionally traveling or hiking.

# Why do I write?

> "It has often been said that a person doesn't really understand something until he teaches it to someone else. Actually a person doesn't really understand something until he can teach it to a computer, i.e. express it as an algorithm." [^1]

Yes indeed, *[docendo discimus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docendo_discimus)*, people are increasingly recognizing the effectiveness of teaching as a learning tool.  Research shows that students who tutor others, in any format, gain a deeper understanding of concepts by having to explain them accurately.  Blogging allows me to document my learning journey, share it with readers, and get their feedback ‚Äì all of which contribute to my own learning.

This blog is devoted my learning & sharing journey, and will be written in Vietnamese/Ti·∫øng Vi·ªát (80%), English (10%), and Mandarin Chinese/Ê±âËØ≠ (10%).
