ðŸ˜Ž I am currently a **Risk Modeler** at [Validus Vietnam](https://validus.vn/). Previously, I gained experience in both financial auditing & analysis, working at a Big-4 Auditing firm and a Manufacturer.

ðŸŽ“ Growing up in a small village next to a rice field, I opted to chase equations instead of grasshoppers by diving into math at the age of 10 (though my current math skills might say otherwise ðŸ‘€). I later graduated with a degree in Accounting & Auditing from the [Foreign Trade University, HCMC Campus](https://www.ftu.edu.vn/).

ðŸ“š When I'm not doing data, I might be:

-   learning math/statistics/data stuff,

-   drinking coffee,

-   listening to Vietnamese rap/pop rock,

-   reading sci-fi novels, history books,

-   playing pool (mostly [ten-ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-ball)),

-   training [Brazilian jiu-jitsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu) (since Feb 2024),

-   and occasionally traveling or hiking.

This blog is devoted my learning & sharing journey, and will be written in Vietnamese/Tiáº¿ng Viá»‡t (80%), English (10%), and Mandarin Chinese/æ±‰è¯­ (10%).

If you share the same interest, do not hesitate to contact me. I am best reached via [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/toilatuan.lk), my CV is also attached.
