::: {#about-block}
üòé I am a Data Science Enthusiast and currently working as a **Senior Data Analyst** at [Validus Vietnam](https://validus.vn/).

üéì Growing up in a small village next to a rice field, I opted to chase equations instead of grasshoppers by diving into math at the age of 10 (though my current math skills might say otherwise üëÄ). I later graduated with a degree in Accounting & Auditing from the [Foreign Trade University, HCMC Campus](https://www.ftu.edu.vn/).

üìö When I'm not doing data, I might be:

-   learning math/statistics/data stuff;

-   drinking coffee;

-   listening to [Vietnamese rap/pop rock](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nnZYnQ6ou7hvXsXd3F-D_S448sd-IZu3s);

-   reading sci-fi novels, history books;

-   playing pool (mostly [ten-ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-ball));

-   training [Brazilian jiu-jitsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu);

-   and occasionally traveling or hiking.

# Why do I write?

> "It has often been said that a person doesn't really understand something until he teaches it to someone else. Actually a person doesn't really understand something until he can teach it to a computer, i.e. express it as an algorithm." [^1]

Yes, until I can explain the *accrual accounting concept* to my non-accountant friend or build a pure Python code without dependencies to run a *logistic regression*, I cannot feel confident that I understand these things.

Also inspired by [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/) - a great teacher to me, who always repeats the famous quote ‚Äú*What I cannot create, I do not understand*‚Äù by [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman), I create this website to capture my learning journey to understand how things work. Most of content is currently things I am learning, but yeah I'll also write to share and teach things I know and to get feedback, [*docendo discimus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docendo_discimus)!

This is some kind of Sandbox learning method and it's depicted in the picture below:

If you share the same interest, do not hesitate to contact me. I am best reached via [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/toilatuan.lk).

This blog will be written in Vietnamese/Ti·∫øng Vi·ªát (80%), English (10%), and Mandarin Chinese/Ê±âËØ≠ (10%). Attaching a comment tool for my website is a TODO item, I am considering [utteranc](https://utteranc.es/), and [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/).
