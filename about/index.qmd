::: {#about-block}
üòé I am a Data Science Enthusiast and currently working as a **Senior Data Analyst** at [Validus Vietnam](https://validus.vn/).

üéì Growing up in a small village next to a rice field, I opted to chase equations instead of grasshoppers by diving into math at the age of 10 (though my current math skills might say otherwise üëÄ). I later graduated with a degree in Accounting & Auditing from the [Foreign Trade University, HCMC Campus](https://www.ftu.edu.vn/).

üìö When I'm not doing data, I might be:

-   learning math/statistics/data stuff,

-   drinking coffee,

-   listening to Vietnamese rap/pop rock,

-   reading sci-fi novels, history books,

-   playing pool (mostly [ten-ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-ball)),

-   training [Brazilian jiu-jitsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu),

-   and occasionally traveling or hiking.

# Why do I write?

> "It has often been said that a person doesn't really understand something until he teaches it to someone else. Actually a person doesn't really understand something until he can teach it to a computer, i.e. express it as an algorithm." [^1]

Yes, [*docendo discimus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docendo_discimus)! Through this blog, I aim to deepen my own understanding by breaking down complex concepts into clear, digestible explanations. Each post is an opportunity for me to structure my thoughts, challenge my assumptions, and engage with readers who bring fresh perspectives. This isn't just about broadcasting knowledge - it's about creating a space for collaborative learning and discovery.

This blog is devoted my learning & sharing journey, and will be written in Vietnamese/Ti·∫øng Vi·ªát (80%), English (10%), and Mandarin Chinese/Ê±âËØ≠ (10%).
