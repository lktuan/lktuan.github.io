# Preparation

I need to install the following packages:

```{r}
# | eval: false
# install CRAN packages
pkg_install =   c("ggplot2", "tibble", "tidyr", "forcats", "purrr", "prismatic", "corrr", 
    "cowplot", "ggforce", "ggrepel", "ggridges", "ggsci", "ggtext", "ggthemes", 
    "grid", "gridextra", "patchwork", "rcartocolor", "scico", "showtext", 
    "shiny", "plotly", "highcharter", "echarts4r")
# install.packages(pkg_install)


```

I was facing the error of installing devtools

```{r}
# | eval: false
# install from GitHub since not on CRAN
# install.packages('devtools')
# devtools::install_github("JohnCoene/charter")
```

I tried to update R to the latest version (commented the code as it would be run once)

```{r}
# | eval: false
# update.packages(repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/', ask=FALSE, checkBuilt=TRUE)
```

--\> Not worked

**Oops I was should be using "'devtools'" instead of "devtools"!!! Problem solved**

# The Dataset

I was using the dataset: "*National Morbidity and Mortality Air Pollution Study*Â (NMMAPS)"

Install the readr first:

```{r}
# | eval: false
# install.packages('readr')
```

#### Import data

": :" here call the namespace and can be used to access a function without loading the package.

```{r}
chic <- readr::read_csv("https://cedricscherer.com/data/chicago-nmmaps-custom.csv")
```

view some data

```{r}
tibble::glimpse(chic)
```

```{r}
head(chic,10)
```

# The {ggplot2} Package

A ggplot is built up from a few basic elements:

1.  Data;
2.  Geometries `geom_`: the geometric shape that will represent the data;
3.  Aesthetics `aes_`: aesthetics of the geometric or statistical objects, such as postition, color, size, shape, and transparency;
4.  Scales `scale_`: map between the data and the aesthetics dimensions, such as data raneg to plot width or factor values to colors;
5.
