Back in 2018, I first heard the word "BJJ" when I joined a martial discussion group named ["DOG Brothers Team Vietnam"](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1384082055164738). There was an active club name ["RONIN BJJ Hanoi "](https://www.facebook.com/RoninBjjHanoi/), but I never tried to find out what BJJ was.
