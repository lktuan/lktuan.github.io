I've heard that Observable released their Framework as open source in April 2024, and Quarto also supported Observable natively since version 1.4 (?), thus decided to give it a try. Could not agree more with their slogan:

> The best dashboards are built with `code`.

This is my [repo](https://github.com/lktuan/first-observable-project) for the practice.

🚀 **Observable Framwork** [documentation](https://observablehq.com/framework/).

> Observable Framework — or “Framework” for short — is an open-source static-site generator for data apps. By data app we mean an application that is primarily a display of data. Data apps help you derive insights (to understand) and evaluate potential decisions (to take action).

It can be a set of coordinated **interactive visualizations** for “self-service” analysis, a **live dashboard**, or a **point-in-time report** that combines graphics and prose to present in-depth analysis.

Why use Framework for your data app?

-   The power of code: Empowered by D3 and Observable Plot library, there’s no limit to what you can create.
-   Polyglot meets the web: Framework is *polyglot* \~ it brings multiple languages together.
-   Static-site architecture: Framework’s data architecture practically forces your app to be fast because data is precomputed at build time. Furthermore, data snapshots can be highly-optimized (and aggregated and anonymized), minimizing what you send to the client.
-   Automatic reactivity: Instead of wrangling hooks or signals, you can write declarative code in vanilla JavaScript that automatically re-runs whenever variables change, like a spreadsheet.
-   An end-to-end solution: Well-designed tools let developers focus on high-value, creative work and build better apps.

Let's start!

# Inititate a new Project

🚀 **Observable Framwork** [getting started]()

The prerequisite is we must have [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed on our machine. Running `npm -v`, I know that I have version `10.5.0` installed.

We first create a folder and navigate to it:

``` bash
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
mkdir first-observable-project
cd first-observable-project
```

Then simply run this command to initiate the project:

``` bash
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
npm init "@observablehq"
```

We gotta fill some basic params:

``` bash
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
┌   observable create  v1.5.1

We can now easilly preview the app with `npm run dev`, and access out dashboard via `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`. Let's play a little bit, we can modify the `h1` tags in `docs\index.md`, then the dashboard will be updated once we save the file, instantly. Cool!

Here is the structure of my project (after adding those Data Loader, SQL, etc steps below):

``` ini
```

## Self hosting

We don’t have to deploy to Observable — Framework projects are simply static sites, so we can host them anywhere. With `npm`, we can run `npm run build`, which will generates the `dist` directory. We can then copy this directory to your static site server or preferred hosting service, like [`http-server`](https://github.com/http-party/http-server), with command `npx http-server dist`.

For deployment, see the final section at the bottom of this article.

# Write first Data Loader

In Observable project we can write Data Loader in JavaScript, Python, R or any other languages. Data Loader helps you to (1) minimize file sizes and (2) reduce client side processing.

A data loader file has the name like: `dataloader.data_extension.engine_extension`. For example, with the American weather forecast API we can have 2 kinds of Data Loader as below:

**Javascript 🟨**:

``` {.julia filename="forecast.json.js"}
const longitude = -122.47;
const latitude = 37.8;

async function json(url) {
  const response = await fetch(url, {headers: {"User-Agent": "(observablehq.com, support@observablehq.com)"}});
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`fetch failed: ${response.status}`);
  return await response.json();
}

const station = await json(`https://api.weather.gov/points/${latitude},${longitude}`);
const forecast = await json(station.properties.forecastHourly);

process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify(forecast));
```

**Python 🐍**:

``` {.python filename="forecast.json.py"}
import json
import requests
import sys

longitude = -122.47
latitude = 37.80

station = requests.get(f"https://api.weather.gov/points/{latitude},{longitude}").json()
forecast = requests.get(station["properties"]["forecastHourly"]).json()

json.dump(forecast, sys.stdout)
```

Run the data loader, testing if it work:

``` bash
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
node hi-observable\docs\data\forecast.json.js

# or

python hi-observable\docs\data\forecast.json.py
```

Now if we refresh the dashboard page, the weather forecasting tab should be there. My first run was failed as I miss a comma in JS file 😂. If we change the data loader, the dashboard will change concurrently.

# SQL in Observable Framework

# Grids, Cards, and Themes

The `Grid` class allow us to organize multiple vizualization in a denser format, like a dashboard. The `Grid` class declares a grid container.

# Deployment a Project

# Imports: from npm, local files, remote URLs, and lazy loading
