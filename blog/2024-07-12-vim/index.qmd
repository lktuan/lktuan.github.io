in an effort not to give Vim up from the very first day. inspired by James Powell's Vim skill in his every Python lecture.

after a few days of rolling with neovim i already have a somewhat calls sense of how to install, make the `nvim` config folder, do some `git clone` stuffs to download a bunch of i have no idea what they are to use vim in my damn window machine. can do `nvim file1`, `:qw`, `:below terminal`, `:vsplit`, but in general lots of actions i am not yet familiar with so actually could not stick with this editor.

now back to basics, i am spending Friyay night starting from scratch. Florian Dedov uses vim while i use nvim expecting both to be the same.
