# 1. [Calculated columns](https://www.wiseowl.co.uk/power-bi/exercises/dax/calculated-columns/)

Including 11 exercises:

#### 1 [Operations in Row context](https://www.wiseowl.co.uk/power-bi/exercises/dax/calculated-columns/5086/)

It's pretty simple to calculate the *total floors*, just find the **New column** under **Table tools**, and sum the floors up:

```js
Total floors = Building[Floors above ground] + Building[Floors below ground]
```

#### 2 [!DIV0](https://www.wiseowl.co.uk/power-bi/exercises/dax/calculated-columns/4409/)

And for *Average floor height*, we just need to use "/", or better practice, use `DIVIDE()`:

```js
Average floor height = Building[Height m] / Building[Floors above ground]

// or

Average floor height = DIVIDE(Building[Height m], Building[Floors above ground])
```

For each column, we have column tools to format the data.

#### 3 [Flow control with `IF()` and `SWITCH()`](https://www.wiseowl.co.uk/power-bi/exercises/dax/calculated-columns/5089/)

The `IF()` in DAX row context is pretty the same with Excel!

```js
Has basement = IF(Building[Floors below ground] > 0, "Yes", "No")
Century = IF(Building[Year Opened] < 2001, "20th Century", "21st Century")
```

Do you ever use `SWITCH()` in Excel, it's the same in PBI:

```js
Category =
SWITCH (
    TRUE (),
    Building[Height m] < 400, "Tiny",
    Building[Height m] < 500, "Small",
    Building[Height m] < 600, "Medium",
    Building[Height m] < 700, "Big",
    "Large"
)
```

#### 4 [More operations](https://www.wiseowl.co.uk/power-bi/exercises/dax/calculated-columns/5088/)

```js
// This is simple
Tour length = Tour[End year] - Tour[Start year] + 1

// With division operation, it's recommended to use DIVIDE() function:
Shows per year = DIVIDE(Tour[Shows], Tour[Tour length])
Avg show revenue = DIVIDE(Tour[Actual gross], Tour[Shows])
Avg attendance = DIVIDE(Tour[Attendance], Tour[Shows])
Avg ticket price = DIVIDE(Tour[Actual gross], Tour[Attendance])
```

#### 5 [Using of `RELATED()`](https://www.wiseowl.co.uk/power-bi/exercises/dax/calculated-columns/5091/)

We can use "**&**" or the `CONCANATE()` function to join texts (in row context), and use `RELATED()` to get data from other tables with a relationship set up.

```js
Name and location = CONCATENATE(Building[Building Name] & ", ", RELATED(City[City]))

// or if we want to include the Country name

Name and location =
CONCATENATE (
    Building[Building Name] & ", ",
    RELATED ( City[City] ) & ", "
        & RELATED ( Country[Country] )
)
```

#### 6 [Handling mismatch with `RELATED()`](https://www.wiseowl.co.uk/power-bi/exercises/dax/calculated-columns/4410/)

We can use `RELATED()` and `ISBLANK()` to refer and check if there any matching record is returned.

```c
Quadrant =
IF (
    ISBLANK ( RELATED ( Quadrants[QuadrantName] ) ),
    "No quadrant found",
    RELATED ( Quadrants[QuadrantName] )
)

Region =
IF (
    ISBLANK ( RELATED ( Regions[RegionName] ) ),
    "No region assigned",
    RELATED ( Regions[RegionName] )
)
```

#### 7 [Context transition in calculated column](https://www.wiseowl.co.uk/power-bi/exercises/dax/calculated-columns/4417/)

The first one *Total sales* was calculated in **Products** table, simply interate all the table **Purchase**, multiply *quanity* by *price* to get the entire revenue:

```c
Total Sales = SUMX(Purchase, Purchase[Quantity] * Purchase[Price])
```

The second one - *Sales for product*, we want to calculate the corresponding sales for each product at the current row, so we just **wrap** the `CALCULATE()` function for the **context transition**:

```c
Sales for product =
CALCULATE (
    SUMX ( Purchase, Purchase[Quantity] * Purchase[Price] )
)
```

And the final one:

```c
Product contribution = DIVIDE([Sales for product],[Total sales])
```
