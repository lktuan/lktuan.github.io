        "\n",
        "**Problem Statement**:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Traditional n-gram language models suffer from the *curse of dimensionality*: they can't effectively generalize to word sequences not seen in training data;\n",
        "-   The core issue is treating words as atomic units with no *inherent similarity* to each other;\n",
        "-   For example, if we've seen \"dog is eating\" in training but never \"cat is eating\", n-gram models can't leverage the similarity between \"dog\" and \"cat\";\n",
        "-   This leads to poor probability estimates for rare or unseen word sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Solution**:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Learn a *distributed representation* (embedding) for each word in a continuous vector space where similar words are close to each other;\n",
        "-   Use a neural network architecture with:\n",
        "    -   Input layer: concatenated embeddings of n-1 previous words;\n",
        "    -   Hidden layer: dense neural network with `tanh` activation;\n",
        "    -   Output layer: softmax over entire vocabulary to predict next word probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The model simultaneously learns**:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Word feature vectors (embeddings) that capture *semantic/syntactic word similarities*;\n",
        "-   Neural network parameters that combine these features to estimate probability distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key advantages**:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Words with similar meanings get similar feature vectors, enabling better *generalization*;\n",
        "-   The probability function is smooth with respect to word embeddings, so similar words yield *similar predictions*;\n",
        "-   Can generalize to *unseen sequences* by leveraging learned word similarities.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Methodology:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Traditional Problem:\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   In n-gram models, each word sequence of length n is a separate parameter;\n",
        "    -   For vocabulary size $|V|$, need $|V|^n$ parameters;\n",
        "    -   Most sequences never appear in training, leading to poor generalization;\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Solution via **Distributed Representation**:\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   Each word mapped to a dense vector in $R^m$ (typically m=50-100);\n",
        "    -   Similar words get similar vectors through training;\n",
        "    -   Probability function is smooth w.r.t these vectors;\n",
        "    -   Key benefit: If \"dog\" and \"cat\" have similar vectors, model can generalize from \"dog is eating\" to \"cat is eating\";\n",
        "    -   Number of parameters reduces to $O(|V|×m + m×h + h×|V|)$, where $h$ is hidden layer size;\n",
        "    -   This is much smaller than $|V|^n$ and allows better generalization;\n",

        "-   $x$ dimension is $(n-1)×m$;\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hidden Layer**:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Dense layer with tanh activation;\n",
        "-   Computation: $h = tanh(d + Hx)$;\n",
        "-   $H$ is weight matrix, $d$ is bias vector;\n",
        "-   Maps concatenated context to hidden representation;\n",

        "-   Computes probability distribution over all words;\n",
        "-   $y = b + Wx + Uh$;\n",
        "-   Softmax activation: $P(wₜ|context) = exp(yᵢ)/Σⱼexp(yⱼ)$;\n",
