# Part 1: LLMs

## 1.1 Introduction

- 30-minute introductory talk on Large Language Models
- Originally presented at Scale AI event
- Aimed at providing comprehensive yet accessible overview
- Focus on practical understanding rather than theoretical complexity

## 1.2 LLM Inference

LLM consists of two essential files:

- Parameters file (weights)
- Contains neural network weights
- For Llama 2 70B: 140GB size
- Uses float16 format (2 bytes per parameter)
- Self-contained package of learned information

Run file (execution code)

- Approximately 500 lines of C code
- No external dependencies required
- Can be implemented in any programming language
- Handles neural network architecture and forward pass

Key features:

- Fully self-contained system
- Works offline without internet
- Can run on standard hardware (though speed varies)
- Smaller models (7B) run faster than larger ones (70B)

## 1.3 LLM Training

Training Requirements:

- Input Data: ~10 terabytes of internet text
- Hardware: 6,000 specialized GPUs
- Duration: 12 days (for Llama 2 70B)
- Cost: Approximately $2 million

Training Process:

- Internet crawling for text collection
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Compression ratio: roughly 100:1
- Lossy compression (unlike zip files)

Modern State-of-the-Art Models:

- 10x more resources than Llama 2
- Training costs: tens to hundreds of millions
- Much larger datasets and GPU clusters
- Longer training periods

## 1.4 LLM Dreams (Text Generation)

Core Functionality:

- Next-word prediction based on context
- Continuous feedback loop of generation
- Probability-based word selection

Generated Content Types:

- Code Generation
- Programming language syntax
- Function structures
- Documentation
- Product Descriptions
- Including metadata (ISBN, prices)
- Formatting and structure
- Wikipedia-style Articles
- Factual information mixed with generation
- Proper formatting and style

Content Characteristics:

- Blend of memorized and generated information
- Maintains consistent style and format
- Can include "hallucinated" details
- Sometimes surprisingly accurate information

## 1.5 Technical Architecture

Transformer Architecture:

- Complex neural network structure
- Multiple layers and connections
- Attention mechanisms
- Parameter distribution throughout network

Operational Aspects:

- Clear understanding of architecture
- Unclear parameter interactions
- Empirical optimization process
- Next-word prediction as core task

Knowledge Representation:
Distributed across billions of parameters
Complex internal relationships
Sometimes exhibits unexpected behaviors
Knowledge compression and retrieval mechanisms
